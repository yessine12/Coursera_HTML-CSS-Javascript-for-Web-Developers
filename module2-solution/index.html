      Chicken
    </div>
      <p>
          Chicken fingers are prepared by coating the meat in breadcrumbs, before being fried, in a manner similar to the preparation of breaded cutlets.
          It is a common preparation in the United States and it is found in fast food.

      Beef
    </div>
      <p>
          The high heat of grilling sears the surface of beef, creating tender meat with a flavorful crust. The required cooking temperature and the method of grilling (direct, indirect, or a combination) depends on the cut of beef and the quality of the meat.
